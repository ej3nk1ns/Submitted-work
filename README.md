Essays, briefings, presentations submitted for masters assessment

The files feasStudy.pdf and presnSlides.pdf were written for the preparation course for my Masters dissertation.  Code and documents for my dissertation, which will be submitted in August 2024, are held within the university's GitLab environment, and so are not publicly accessible.  Other documents should be fairly self-explanatory.
